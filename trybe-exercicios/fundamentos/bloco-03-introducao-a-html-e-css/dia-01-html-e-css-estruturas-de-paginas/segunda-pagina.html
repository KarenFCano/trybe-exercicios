    Sensors indicate human life forms 30 meters below the planet's surface. Stellar flares are
    increasing in magnitude and frequency. Set course for Rhomboid Dronegar 006, warp seven. There's no evidence of an
    advanced communication network. Total guidance system failure, with less than 24 hours' reserve power. Shield
    effectiveness has been reduced 12 percent. We have covered the area in a spherical pattern which a ship without warp
    drive could cross in the given time.

    Now what are the possibilities of warp drive? Cmdr Rikers nervous system has been invaded by an unknown
    microorganism. The organisms fuse to the nerve, intertwining at the molecular level. That's why the transporter's
    biofilters couldn't extract it. The vertex waves show a K-complex corresponding to an REM state. The engineering
    section's critical. Destruction is imminent. Their robes contain ultritium, highly explosive, virtually undetectable
    by your transporter.

    We're acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon, but this... Is a remarkable piece of bio-electronic
    engineering by which I see much of the EM spectrum ranging from heat and infrared through radio waves, et cetera,
    and forgive me if I've said and listened to this a thousand times. This planet's interior heat provides an abundance
    of geothermal energy. We need to neutralize the homing signal.

    Communication is not possible. The shuttle has no power. Using the gravitational pull of a star to
    slingshot back in time? We are going to Starbase Montgomery for Engineering consultations prompted by minor read-out
    anomalies. Probes have recorded unusual levels of geological activity in all five planetary systems. Assemble a
    team. Look at records of the Drema quadrant. Would these scans detect artificial transmissions as well as natural
    signals?

    Shields up. I recommend we transfer power to phasers and arm the photon torpedoes. Something strange
    on the detector circuit. The weapons must have disrupted our communicators. You saw something as tasty as meat, but
    inorganically materialized out of patterns used by our transporters. Captain, the most elementary and valuable
    statement in science, the beginning of wisdom, is 'I do not know.' All transporters off.

    Run a manual sweep of anomalous airborne or electromagnetic readings. Radiation levels in our atmosphere have
    increased by 3,000 percent. Electromagnetic and subspace wave fronts approaching synchronization. What is the
    strength of the ship's deflector shields at maximum output? The wormhole's size and short period would make this a
    local phenomenon. Do you have sufficient data to compile a holographic simulation? </p>

    Unidentified vessel travelling at sub warp speed, bearing 235.7. Fluctuations in energy readings from it, Captain.
    All transporters off. A strange set-up, but I'd say the graviton generator is depolarized. The dark colourings of
    the scrapes are the leavings of natural rubber, a type of non-conductive sole used by researchers experimenting with
    electricity. The molecules must have been partly de-phased by the anyon beam.

    Exceeding reaction chamber thermal limit. We have begun power-supply calibration. Force fields have been established
    on all turbo lifts and crawlways. Computer, run a level-two diagnostic on warp-drive systems. Antimatter containment
    positive. Warp drive within normal parameters. I read an ion trail characteristic of a freighter escape pod. The
    bomb had a molecular-decay detonator. Detecting some unusual fluctuations in subspace frequencies.
